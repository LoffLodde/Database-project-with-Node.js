# Database-project-with-Node.js
I am at the moment trying to explore node.js and different JS packages. 
The main goal with this project however is to get test out and hopefully get comfortable with data exchange between my SQL-server and webapplication. In addition to working with different types of requests.
I don't really have a spesiffic theme or anything like that, it's just for fun.
